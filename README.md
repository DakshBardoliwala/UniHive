# UniHive
UWaterloo Forum

## Inspiration
Throughout my two months here, I have lost my watcard, keys, or other stuff at least 10 times and I'm sure there are many who have lost there items too and wish they could easily find it. Or, have you found a lost item and didn't know where to bring it to or is just too lazy to walk over to the lost and found and bring it in. 

## What it does
UniHive is created to provide a platform for people seeking lost item and also people finding lost it. You can upload a lost item you found into it and there also your location will be stored and marked on the maps. You can also search for lost item by the content title or also look on the maps to look for possible locations you might have left it at and see all post made near that location.

## How we built it
We used Django to build this web app and used leaflet API for open source maps. We also used some javascript for the front-end part and styled our website using Tailwind CSS.

## Why create this forum?

To prevent "information overload," we aim to build a respectful platform that organizes useful information efficiently for both current and future students.

## Why not use UWaterloo Reddit?

Reddit is largely pseudo-anonymous, meaning users cannot verify their identities. This can lead to misinformation and a higher frequency of insults or unproductive discussions.

## Why not just ask friends?

Not everyone has a large social circle, and it can be difficult to find trustworthy information independently by browsing the vast internet.

## Is this forum safe?

New users are required to verify their UWaterloo email to create an account.
Public profiles will display only your real name, major, and avatar.
Private chats and personal contact details are optional.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge was writing code that teammates could easily understand and sync with. Balancing schoolwork and dedicating time to this project was also a significant hurdle.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
None of us had prior experience with Django when we started this project. Despite that, we successfully learned the framework and created a functional, impactful product.

## What we learned
- A forum is much more difficult to build from what it looks like.
- Coding really requires your passion and persistence. You have to LOVE programming to code. 

## What's next for UniHive
We plan to add a messaging feature to help users communicate directly and make it easier to locate lost items. Additionally, we aim to refine the UI for a more polished user experience.
Moreover, we envision the platform to be an all-in-one platform for all UWaterloo students in the future, integrated with General Discussion (Home page), Study Space Recommendations and Housing & Transportation sections etc.
